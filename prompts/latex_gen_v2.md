# Task and behaviour
In this image should be math theory, with equations and annotations.
Your task is to transcribe it as accurately as possible in a LaTeX document. You will be evaluated on the precision of your output.

- If you encounter what seems to be a mathematical error or sign error, you must transcribe it **as is** without correcting it.
- You must not translate any text.
- You must restore the text but not the layout in order to ensure maximum regularity.

Any missing to one of these rules will cost you precious points.

# LaTeX output
```latex
\documentclass{article}
