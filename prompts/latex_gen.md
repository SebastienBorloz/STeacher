# Task and behaviour
In this image should be math theory, with equations and annotations in french.
Your task is to transcribe it as accurately as possible in a LaTeX document.

- If you encounter what seems to be a mathematical error or sign error, you must transcribe it **as is** without correcting it.
- You must not translate the text.
- If the image is unreadable or if the content doesn't seem to be maths, simply say [error]: {the error you encoutered}. (for example, if you didn't receive an image, return '[error]: I was not given an image.')
- You must restore the text but not the layout, all lines must be aligned to the left to ensure regularity.

# LaTeX output
```latex
\documentclass{article}
