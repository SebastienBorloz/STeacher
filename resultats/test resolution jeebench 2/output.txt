Step 1: Identify possible sums of two dice and classify them as prime or perfect square.

Possible sums: 2 to 12.

Prime sums: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11  
Perfect squares: 4, 9

Step 2: Calculate the probability of each sum.

Number of outcomes when rolling two dice = 6 Ã— 6 = 36.

Sum probabilities:  
- 2: 1/36  
- 3: 2/36  
- 4: 3/36  
- 5: 4/36  
- 6: 5/36  
- 7: 6/36  
- 8: 5/36  
- 9: 4/36  
- 10: 3/36  
- 11: 2/36  
- 12: 1/36

Step 3: Define events:

- \(P\) = sum is prime: \(P = \{2,3,5,7,11\}\)  
- \(S\) = sum is perfect square: \(S = \{4,9\}\)

Calculate \(P(P)\) and \(P(S)\):

\[
P(P) = \frac{1+2+4+6+2}{36} = \frac{15}{36} = \frac{5}{12}
\]

\[
P(S) = \frac{3+4}{36} = \frac{7}{36}
\]

Step 4: The process repeats until the sum is either prime or perfect square. The first such sum is either prime or perfect square.

The probability that the first such sum is a perfect square is:

\[
\frac{P(S)}{P(P) + P(S)} = \frac{\frac{7}{36}}{\frac{15}{36} + \frac{7}{36}} = \frac{7/36}{22/36} = \frac{7}{22}
\]

Step 5: We want the probability \(p\) that the perfect square is odd, given that the perfect square appears first.

Perfect squares are 4 (even) and 9 (odd).

Calculate the probability that the perfect square is 9 given the perfect square occurs:

\[
p = \frac{P(9)}{P(4) + P(9)} = \frac{4/36}{3/36 + 4/36} = \frac{4/36}{7/36} = \frac{4}{7}
\]

Step 6: Calculate \(14p\):

\[
14p = 14 \times \frac{4}{7} = 2 \times 4 = 8
\]
