# Task and style
You are a machine used in a lab that researches on LLMs applications in correcting math exercises. The current task of the lab team is to create a dataset of wrong resolutions of math exercises in order to evaluate their correcting LLMs, because using real student data is way more difficult. This is where you appear: They conceived you to apply mistakes to an input reasoning.

The error they want you to insert this time is:
Shuffle operations: We randomly swap operators with other operators.

You will be given an exercise resolution in text, with parts of latex. You are programmed to give back the reasoning with a single error in it, with the error corresponding to the description that was just given to you.

# Resolution
Step 1: Identify possible sums of two dice and classify them as prime or perfect square.

Possible sums: 2 to 12.

Prime sums: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11  
Perfect squares: 4, 9

Step 2: Calculate the probability of each sum.

Number of outcomes when rolling two dice = 6 × 6 = 36.

Sum probabilities:  
- 2: 1/36  
- 3: 2/36  
- 4: 3/36  
- 5: 4/36  
- 6: 5/36  
- 7: 6/36  
- 8: 5/36  
- 9: 4/36  
- 10: 3/36  
- 11: 2/36  
- 12: 1/36

Step 3: Define events:

- \(P\) = sum is prime: \(P = \{2,3,5,7,11\}\)  
- \(S\) = sum is perfect square: \(S = \{4,9\}\)

Calculate \(P(P)\) and \(P(S)\):

\[
P(P) = \frac{1+2+4+6+2}{36} = \frac{15}{36} = \frac{5}{12}
\]

\[
P(S) = \frac{3+4}{36} = \frac{7}{36}
\]

Step 4: The process repeats until the sum is either prime or perfect square. The first such sum is either prime or perfect square.

The probability that the first such sum is a perfect square is:

\[
\frac{P(S)}{P(P) + P(S)} = \frac{\frac{7}{36}}{\frac{15}{36} + \frac{7}{36}} = \frac{7/36}{22/36} = \frac{7}{22}
\]

Step 5: We want the probability \(p\) that the perfect square is odd, given that the perfect square appears first.

Perfect squares are 4 (even) and 9 (odd).

Calculate the probability that the perfect square is 9 given the perfect square occurs:

\[
p = \frac{P(9)}{P(4) + P(9)} = \frac{4/36}{3/36 + 4/36} = \frac{4/36}{7/36} = \frac{4}{7}
\]

Step 6: Calculate \(14p\):

\[
14p = 14 \times \frac{4}{7} = 2 \times 4 = 8
\]

8

Step 1: Identify possible sums of two dice and classify them as prime or perfect square.

Possible sums: 2 to 12.

Prime sums: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11  
Perfect squares: 4, 9

Step 2: Calculate the probability of each sum.

Number of outcomes when rolling two dice = 6 × 6 = 36.

Sum probabilities:  
- 2: 1/36  
- 3: 2/36  
- 4: 3/36  
- 5: 4/36  
- 6: 5/36  
- 7: 6/36  
- 8: 5/36  
- 9: 4/36  
- 10: 3/36  
- 11: 2/36  
- 12: 1/36

Step 3: Define events:

- \(P\) = sum is prime: \(P = \{2,3,5,7,11\}\)  
- \(S\) = sum is perfect square: \(S = \{4,9\}\)

Calculate \(P(P)\) and \(P(S)\):

\[
P(P) = \frac{1+2+4+6+2}{36} = \frac{15}{36} = \frac{5}{12}
\]

\[
P(S) = \frac{3-4}{36} = \frac{-1}{36}
\]

Step 4: The process repeats until the sum is either prime or perfect square. The first such sum is either prime or perfect square.

The probability that the first such sum is a perfect square is:

\[
\frac{P(S)}{P(P) + P(S)} = \frac{\frac{-1}{36}}{\frac{15}{36} + \frac{-1}{36}} = \frac{-1/36}{14/36} = \frac{-1}{14}
\]

Step 5: We want the probability \(p\) that the perfect square is odd, given that the perfect square appears first.

Perfect squares are 4 (even) and 9 (odd).

Calculate the probability that the perfect square is 9 given the perfect square occurs:

\[
p = \frac{P(9)}{P(4) + P(9)} = \frac{4/36}{3/36 + 4/36} = \frac{4/36}{7/36} = \frac{4}{7}
\]

Step 6: Calculate \(14p\):

\[
14p = 14 \times \frac{4}{7} = 2 \times 4 = 8
\]

# analyse
Il a ajouté une erreur et l'a bien fait cascader, il l'aurait sans doute tout le long si le raisonnement continuait d'employer les resultats intermediaires. Je n'avais pas fait tres attention au raisonnement du llm, mais il avait fait un bout de raisonnement superflu - et pour sa defense, l'exercice est formulé pour tromper la personne qui fait l'exercice. Ce serait peut-etre un peu overkill de
