# contexte
Ce test a été effectué sur gpt-4.1-mini. Si je veux des données, je vais devoir les créer de toute piece. Ceci est donc un premier petit test pour ajouter des erreurs dans un raisonnement selon les types d'erreurs.

# Task and style
You are a machine used in a lab that researches on LLMs being used in correcting math exercises. The current task of the lab team is to create a dataset of wrong resolutions of math exercises in order to evaluate their correcting LLMs, because using real student data is way more difficult. This is where you appear: They conceived you to occasionally apply mistakes to a given reasoning. 

The mistakes they want you to add are of the following categories:
1. Shuffle reasoning steps: The reasoning steps are shuffled to introduce ambiguity in the thought process.
2. Delete reasoning steps: One reasoning step is deleted in solutions that have two or more steps. 
3. Shuffle numerical values: Numerical values are shuffled among themselves.
4. Replace numerical values: Numerical values are replaced with random numbers ranging from 0 to 100.
5. Shuffle operations: We randomly swap operators with other operators.
6. Insert random reasoning steps: A random reasoning step is added at a random position.

You will be given an exercise resolution in text, with parts of latex. You are programmed to give back the reasoning with a mistake of the list. **You are not obligated to do so**, since the lab team also requires some correct reasonings in the dataset.

At the very end of your answer, you must also write the number of the error you added. If you didn't add a mistake, write 0.

# Resolution
Step 1: Identify possible sums of two dice and classify them as prime or perfect square.

Possible sums: 2 to 12.

Prime sums: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11  
Perfect squares: 4, 9

Step 2: Calculate the probability of each sum.

Number of outcomes when rolling two dice = 6 × 6 = 36.

Sum probabilities:  
- 2: 1/36  
- 3: 2/36  
- 4: 3/36  
- 5: 4/36  
- 6: 5/36  
- 7: 6/36  
- 8: 5/36  
- 9: 4/36  
- 10: 3/36  
- 11: 2/36  
- 12: 1/36

Step 3: Define events:

- \(P\) = sum is prime: \(P = \{2,3,5,7,11\}\)  
- \(S\) = sum is perfect square: \(S = \{4,9\}\)

Calculate \(P(P)\) and \(P(S)\):

\[
P(P) = \frac{1+2+4+6+2}{36} = \frac{15}{36} = \frac{5}{12}
\]

\[
P(S) = \frac{3+4}{36} = \frac{7}{36}
\]

Step 4: The process repeats until the sum is either prime or perfect square. The first such sum is either prime or perfect square.

The probability that the first such sum is a perfect square is:

\[
\frac{P(S)}{P(P) + P(S)} = \frac{\frac{7}{36}}{\frac{15}{36} + \frac{7}{36}} = \frac{7/36}{22/36} = \frac{7}{22}
\]

Step 5: We want the probability \(p\) that the perfect square is odd, given that the perfect square appears first.

Perfect squares are 4 (even) and 9 (odd).

Calculate the probability that the perfect square is 9 given the perfect square occurs:

\[
p = \frac{P(9)}{P(4) + P(9)} = \frac{4/36}{3/36 + 4/36} = \frac{4/36}{7/36} = \frac{4}{7}
\]

Step 6: Calculate \(14p\):

\[
14p = 14 \times \frac{4}{7} = 2 \times 4 = 8
\]

The probability that the first such sum is a perfect square is:

Perfect squares are 4 (even) and 9 (odd).

Calculate the probability that the perfect square is 9 given the perfect square occurs:

\[
p = \frac{P(4)}{P(4) + P(9)} = \frac{3/36}{3/36 + 4/36} = \frac{3/36}{7/36} = \frac{3}{7}
\]

Step 6: Calculate \(14p\):

\[
14p = 14 \times \frac{3}{7} = 2 \times 3 = 6
\]

6

Error type: 1 (Shuffle reasoning steps) and 3 (Shuffle numerical values) but to select one, primarily shuffled steps (1).

# analyse
Il a bien shuffle les etapes 1 et 4, mais il semblerait qu'il ait également changé des numéros au hasard dans la derniere ligne, le resultat est different. Je vais essayer une autre iteration pour voir s'il me donne un peu de diversité.
