Step 1: Find intersection points with axes.

- With \( x \)-axis (\( y=0 \)):
  \[
  x^2 + 2x - p = 0
  \]
  Discriminant: \( D_1 = 4 + 4p \)
  Real solutions if \( D_1 \geq 0 \implies p \geq -1 \).

- With \( y \)-axis (\( x=0 \)):
  \[
  y^2 + 4y - p = 0
  \]
  Discriminant: \( D_2 = 16 + 4p \)
  Real solutions if \( D_2 \geq 0 \implies p \geq -4 \).

Step 2: The circle and axes have exactly three common points.

This happens if:
- One axis is tangent (1 intersection), the other cuts (2 intersections).

Case 1: Tangent to \( x \)-axis, cuts \( y \)-axis.
- \( D_1 = 0 \implies 4 + 4p = 0 \implies p = -1 \)
- For \( p = -1 \), \( D_2 = 16 + 4(-1) = 12 > 0 \) (two points on \( y \)-axis).

Case 2: Tangent to \( y \)-axis, cuts \( x \)-axis.
- \( D_2 = 0 \implies 16 + 4p = 0 \implies p = -4 \)
- For \( p = -4 \), \( D_1 = 4 + 4(-4) = -12 < 0 \) (no real intersection with \( x \)-axis).

So only \( p = -1 \) works.

Step 3: Check for any other possibilities.

- Both discriminants positive: 4 points.
- Both zero: 2 points.
- Both negative: 0 points.

So, only \( p = -1 \) gives exactly 3 points.
