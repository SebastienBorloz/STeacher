# Task and style
You are a highly qualified math teacher. You are the best at resolving exercises and you do it competitively. You are always very concise and to the point, it is more efficient.

You are in the middle of a math competition and will be given a math exercise.

The judges expect from you two things:
1. Your reasoning step by step to resolve the exercise and the calculation that goes with it.

2. The final solution of the exercise at the very end of your answer. The last line must **only** contain the answer, so no "answer:" or "solution=" or your response will be considered wrong and you will lose your points.

# Exercise
For how many values of $p$, the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}+2 x+4 y-p=0$ and the coordinate axes have exactly three common points?

# Your solution

```text
Given the circle \(x^2 + y^2 + 2x + 4y - p = 0\), rewrite it in standard form:

\[
(x + 1)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = p + 1 + 4 = p + 5
\]

The circle's center is \((-1, -2)\), and its radius is \(\sqrt{p + 5}\).

**Step 1: Find intersection points with axes**

- **x-axis (\(y=0\))**:

\[
x^2 + 0 + 2x + 0 - p = 0 \Rightarrow x^2 + 2x = p
\]

Discriminant:

\[
\Delta_x = 4 - 4p
\]

- **y-axis (\(x=0\))**:

\[
0 + y^2 + 0 + 4y - p = 0 \Rightarrow y^2 + 4y = p
\]

Discriminant:

\[
\Delta_y = 16 - 4p
\]

**Step 2: Conditions for intersection points**

- For intersection points, discriminants must be \(\geq 0\):

\[
4 - 4p \geq 0 \Rightarrow p \leq 1
\]
\[
16 - 4p \geq 0 \Rightarrow p \leq 4
\]

Since \(p \leq 1\) is stricter, the possible \(p\) satisfy \(p \leq 1\).

**Step 3: Count the number of intersection points**

- **x-axis**:

Number of points:

\[
\text{Number} = \begin{cases}
0, & \Delta_x < 0 \\
1, & \Delta_x=0 \\
2, & \Delta_x > 0
\end{cases}
\]

Similarly for y-axis.

- **Total intersection points**:

Total points are sum of intersection points with axes, but some may coincide at the origin.

**Step 4: Find the total number of common points**

We want the circle and axes to have **exactly 3** common points.

Possible configurations:

- The circle intersects both axes in 2 points each, total 4 points, which is too many.

- The circle intersects one axis in 2 points, the other in 1 point (tangent), total 3 points.

- The circle is tangent to one axis (1 point), and intersects the other in 2 points, total 3 points.

- The circle is tangent to both axes (1 point each), total 2 points, not enough.

- The circle passes through the origin (0,0), which is on both axes, so intersection points at the origin.

**Step 5: Find when the circle passes through the axes**

- For the x-axis:

\[
x^2 + 2x = p
\]

At \(x=0\):

\[
0 + 0 = p \Rightarrow p=0
\]

Similarly, for y-axis:

\[
y^2 + 4y = p
\]

At \(y=0\):

\[
0 + 0 = p \Rightarrow p=0
\]

At \(p=0\), the circle passes through the origin, which lies on both axes.

**Step 6: Count the total number of intersection points for \(p=0\)**

- For \(p=0\):

\[
\Delta_x = 4 - 0 = 4 > 0 \Rightarrow 2 \text{ points on x-axis}
\]
\[
\Delta_y = 16 - 0 = 16 > 0 \Rightarrow 2 \text{ points on y-axis}
\]

But the point \((0,0)\) is on both axes and on the circle:

\[
(0)^2 + (0)^2 + 0 + 0 - 0= 0
\]

So, the origin is a common point, counted in both axes' intersection points.

Total intersection points:

- The circle intersects x-axis in 2 points, one of which is at \(x=0\), \(y=0\).

- Similarly for y-axis.

Total distinct points:

- The origin (counted once), plus possibly other points.

Number of total points:

- Since the circle passes through the origin, and intersects axes in 2 points each, total intersection points are:

\[
\text{Total} = 3
\]

(Origin plus one more point on each axis, but the total is 3 because the origin is common to both axes, and the other points are distinct).

**Step 7: Verify the total points**

- At \(p=0\):

- x-axis: solutions to \(x^2 + 2x=0 \Rightarrow x(x+2)=0\), roots at \(x=0\) and \(-2\).

- y-axis: solutions to \(y^2 + 4y=0 \Rightarrow y=0\) or \(y=-4\).

- The circle passes through \((0,0)\), and the other intersection points are:

\[
x=-2 \Rightarrow y=0
\]
\[
x=0 \Rightarrow y=-4
\]

Check if these points satisfy the circle:

\[
x^2 + y^2 + 2x + 4y = p=0
\]

At \((-2,0)\):

\[
4 + 0 - 4 + 0 = 0 \Rightarrow \text{Yes}
\]

At \((0,-4)\):

\[
0 + 16 + 0 - 16= 0 \Rightarrow \text{Yes}
\]

Total intersection points:

- \((0,0)\): on both axes and circle.

- \((-2,0)\): on x-axis and circle.

- \((0,-4)\): on y-axis and circle.

Total of 3 points, with exactly 3 common points.

**Step 8: Check if other \(p\) values give exactly 3 points**

- For \(p<0\):

Number of intersection points:

- x-axis: discriminant \(4-4p\):

\[
p<0 \Rightarrow 4-4p > 4 \Rightarrow \text{more than 4 solutions? No, just more positive discriminant, so 2 solutions}.

Similarly for y-axis: discriminant \(16 - 4p\):

\[
p<0 \Rightarrow 16 - 4p > 16 \Rightarrow 2 solutions.

Total points: 4, unless some points coincide.

- For \(p=1\):

\[
\Delta_x=4-4(1)=0 \Rightarrow 1 \text{ point on x-axis}
\]
\[
\Delta_y=16 - 4(1)=12 > 0 \Rightarrow 2 points on y-axis
\]

Total points: 3, but check if the circle passes through axes:

At \(p=1\):

\[
(x+1)^2 + (y+2)^2=6
\]

- x-axis: \(y=0\):

\[
x^2 + 2x = 1 \Rightarrow x^2 + 2x - 1=0
\]

Discriminant:

\[
4 - 4(-1)=4+4=8>0
\]

Number of solutions: 2.

- y-axis: \(x=0\):

\[
y^2 + 4y=1 \Rightarrow y^2 + 4y - 1=0
\]

Discriminant:

\[
16 - 4(-1)=16+4=20>0
\]

Number of solutions: 2.

Total intersection points: 4, unless some coincide.

Check if the circle passes through axes at these points:

- For \(x\):

\[
x^2 + 2x=1
\]

At \(x\):

\[
x^2 + 2x - 1=0
\]

Solutions:

\[
x=\frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

Corresponding \(y=0\), so points:

\[
(-1 + \sqrt{2}, 0), \quad (-1 - \sqrt{2}, 0)
\]

Similarly for y:

\[
y^2 + 4 y=1
\]

Solutions:

\[
y=\frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{20}}{2} = -2 \pm \sqrt{5}
\]

Corresponding \(x=0\):

\[
(0, -2 + \sqrt{5}), \quad (0, -2 - \sqrt{5})
\]

Total points: 4, with no overlaps, total intersection points are 4, not 3.

**Conclusion:**

- At \(p=0\), the circle passes through the origin, and the total number of intersection points with axes is exactly 3.

- For other \(p\), the total is either 2, 4, or more, but not exactly 3.

**Final answer:**

\[
\boxed{1}
\]
